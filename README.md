# Nonsmooth-yield-surface
This project includes the implementation of the discrete damage model with multiple non-smooth yield surfaces and its application for engineering problems based on our paper: 

Jin, Wencheng, and ChloÃ© Arson. "Micromechanics based discrete damage model with multiple non-smooth yield surfaces: theoretical formulation, numerical implementation and engineering applications." International Journal of Damage Mechanics 27.5 (2018): 611-639.
